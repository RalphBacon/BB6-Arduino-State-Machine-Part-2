This is PART TWO of the Bacon Bytes series on how we can move to a State Machine on the Arduino (or, indeed, any other microcontroller).

To get the most of of *this video* ensure you have watched PART ONE first which covers the whole multi-tasking element of a useful State Machine that doesn't include any blocking code (such as use of the delay()â˜ statement).

We briefly (ever so briefly) touch on theory but really concentrate on converting a State Diagram into actual Arduino-speak code. It's far easir than you might think.
