This is **PART TWO** of the Bacon Bytes series on a step-by-step guide on how we can move to a **State Machine on the Arduino** (or, indeed, any other microcontroller).

To get the most of of *this video* ensure you have watched **PART ONE** first which covers the whole multi-tasking element of a useful State Machine that doesn't include any blocking code (such as use of the delay()☠statement).

We briefly (ever so briefly) touch on theory but really concentrate on converting a **State Diagram** into actual Arduino-speak C++ code. It's far easir than you might think.

Moreover, it ensures your code reflects the State Diagram you draw, thus ensuring excellent robustness in your code.  

If you really want some in-depth theory, Wikipedia has it covered:
